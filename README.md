# VibeStrings - Guitar Shop Application

This project is a 3-page guitar shop application built with React and Vite. It demonstrates a modern frontend architecture using Apollo Client to fetch data from a GraphQL API, with a focus on a clean user interface and a smooth, interactive user experience.

This application was created as a submission for the Pabau assignment.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Brand Discovery**: A homepage that displays all available guitar brands from the API.
-   **Dynamic Collections Page**: Displays all models for a selected brand.
-   **Advanced Filtering**: Includes a search bar to filter models by name and a dropdown to filter by guitar type (e.g., Acoustic, Electric, Bass).
-   **Efficient Data Loading**: Implements pagination by default and switches to an infinite scroll for a seamless experience when searching.
-   **Detailed Product View**: A dedicated page for each instrument, showing detailed specifications and a list of notable musicians who play it.
